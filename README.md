I work on Prospr Loan Data

The dataset contains 113937 rows and 81 columns
The main features of my interest are LoanStatus, ProsperRating (numeric), and ProsperScore

I converted loan status object into a categorical variable

I perform univariate, bi variate, and multivariate exploration

I follow question, code, observation aproach. I plot the results using regplot, FacetGrid, histograms, heatmap

I find out that there is strong corelation between ProsperScore and ProsperRating (numeric)
